/**
 * Used to speed up overlapping recursive algorithms such as the {@link RodCutterMemo Rod-Cutter Problem} or the {@link Fib Fibanacci Sequence}.
 * <p>Naive Code:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *  fibanacci(nth){
 *   return nth == 1 || nth == 2 ? 1 : fibanacci(nth - 1) + fibanacci(nth - 2);
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>Memoized Code:
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 *  fibanacci(nth){
 *   BiFunction<Function<Integer, Integer>, Integer, Integer> fibFunction = (underTheHoodMemoizer, nth) -> {
 *    return nth == 1 || nth == 2 ? 1 : memoizeIfAbsentOrElseGet.apply(nth - 1) + memoizeIfAbsentOrElseGet.apply(nth - 2);
 *   };
 *   Memoizer.callMemoized(fibFunction, nth);
 *  }
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * <p>Here, the fibanacci method isn't recursively called. 
 * It's replaced by function that does the work for us under the hood in the Memoizer Class.
 * The underTheHoodMemoizer will return the value for the nth term if it exists else,
 * recursively calls the fibFunction again to cache the value for later use.
 * 
 * <p>Eventually, The overlapping recursive calls will call to return values for the same nth terms that have already been computed.
 * Unlike the naive approach, the Memoizer will return the cached value already computed, saving time.
